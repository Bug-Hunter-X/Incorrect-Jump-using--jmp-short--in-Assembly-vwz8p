```assembly
mov ax, bx
add ax, cx
; ... more instructions ...
jmp short label
label:
mov dx, ax
```
This code has a potential bug related to the `jmp short` instruction.  If the label `label` is too far away from the `jmp` instruction, the `short` keyword will cause an incorrect jump.  The assembler will likely issue a warning about this, but it's not always caught, especially if the warning level is low.  The `jmp short` instruction only supports a relative offset within -128 to +127 bytes.  If the code exceeds this, the jump will target the wrong memory location resulting in unpredictable behavior.
