```assembly
mov ax, bx
add ax, cx
; ... more instructions ...
jmp label ; Removed 'short' qualifier
label:
mov dx, ax
```
This solution replaces `jmp short label` with `jmp label`.  The `short` modifier is unnecessary in this case and could lead to an error if the label `label` is too far from the instruction. Removing `short` allows for jumps to any address within the code segment.  It's crucial to ensure the jump target is correctly calculated during assembly to avoid unexpected jumps and program errors.
